# GsonRequest
将volley和Gson结合使用的例子。GsonRequest.java可以直接拿来用。
Using volley and Gson's example.GsonRequest.Java can be used directly.

Volley has three request. StringRequest, JsonObjectRequest and JsonArrayRequest.
But if you request a json data, as we know ,Gson is a effictive tool to parse json data.
Volley don't hava GsonRequest and XmlRequest java files.but I finished it by imitating StringRequest

I can use to request json data and parse json data in the same time.
